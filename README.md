### üë©‚Äçüíª Pinch to resize any window
![](https://github.com/kentywang/Origami/blob/master/demo.gif)

On macOS, there are plenty of trackpad gestures for navigating the desktop environment, such as switching between Spaces or viewing all windows open. But manually resizing a window still requires placing the cursor over the edge of a window and dragging. And if I wanted to also resize in another direction, I would have to place the cursor over the other edge and drag again. Considering the technology available, I think this is pretty unrefined.

I built this app so that I could resize windows the same way I zoom in and out when looking at photos: by spreading and pinching with two fingers. This means that windows can be resized in all four directions simultaneously and independently.

### Usage
Hold down Option (‚å•) and Command (‚åò) and use one finger to drag the entire window or two fingers to resize it.

### Download

### Acknowledgements
Thanks goes to [jnordberg](https://github.com/jnordberg) for building a solution to retrieve raw multitouch data from the trackpad and also for building a [great visualization app](https://github.com/jnordberg/FingerMgmt) for the data that came in super handy for sensitivity tuning and debugging.

Thanks also goes to [keith](https://github.com/keith) for providing a [nice Swift app](https://github.com/keith/ModMove) that served as this app's base.
